Scaleton: I was half-expecting you to bail on me

Boney: Come on, you know I've got your back. Key's in my pocket, plan's all set. Ready to light up the surface with your jokes?

Scaleton: Yeah, been dreaming about this forever. Just... what if I bomb up there?

Boney: Bomb? You're all bones, buddy! What's there to lose? *laughs* Just try not to drop your skull when you're dropping punchlines

Scaleton: Hilarious *pauses* But seriously, is this even safe?

Boney: Safe as it'll ever be! And hey, how about a quick game of football for old times' sake?

Scaleton: Football now? You're not serious

Boney: Absolutely! A final kick-about in the underworld, what do you say?

Scaleton: Alright, game on. But let's not dawdle

[They engage in a game of football, their laughter echoing under the moonlit sky, reliving a fragment of their past.]

Boney: This is the life, huh? Alright, game's over. Time for the real deal. Ready to hit that secret passage?

Scaleton: Yeah, let's do this. Surface, here I come!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scaleton: "Nice move!"
Boney: "Try harder, Scale!"
Scaleton: "Gotcha!"
Boney: "Too slow!"
Scaleton: "Your turn, Boney!"
Boney: "Watch this!"
Scaleton: "Sneaky!"
Boney: "Blocked!"
Scaleton: "Ha, missed!"
Boney: "Scored again!"

The Garners' place, mysterious yet charming. They collect unique artifacts, always something new in their window, like last week's handless clock. But the real magic is Mrs. Garner's legendary pies, rumored to be a 'borrowed' recipe from the surface.

The Goodwins' house, where Boney lives. His dad is the heart of our community, a true family skeleton. Their home was my second childhood playground, always welcoming. They run the local bar, a place that brings everyone together, feeling like family.

I shouldn't head this way - my path lies in the other direction, where my buddy already went
No use going here. I need to follow the other way, where my friend has headed
This isn't my route. I must go the opposite way, following where my pal ventured

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You know, there's this memory from when I was a kid. We were playing soccer and these older teens took our ball. But my buddy, he challenged them to a game for it. We played, won, and got our ball back. Felt like heroes that day
