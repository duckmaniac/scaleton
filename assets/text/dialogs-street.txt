Scaleton: I was half-expecting you to bail on me

Boney: Come on, you know I've got your back. Key's in my pocket, plan's all set. Ready to light up the surface with your jokes?

Scaleton: Yeah, been dreaming about this forever. Just... what if I bomb up there?

Boney: Bomb? You're all bones, buddy! What's there to lose? *laughs* Just try not to drop your skull when you're dropping punchlines

Scaleton: Hilarious *pauses* But seriously, is this even safe?

Boney: Safe as it'll ever be! And hey, how about a quick game of football for old times' sake?

Scaleton: Football now? You're not serious

Boney: Absolutely! A final kick-about in the underworld, what do you say?

Scaleton: Alright, game on. But let's not dawdle

[They engage in a game of football, their laughter echoing under the moonlit sky, reliving a fragment of their past.]

Boney: This is the life, huh? Alright, game's over. Time for the real deal. Ready to hit that secret passage?

Scaleton: Yeah, let's do this. Surface, here I come!
