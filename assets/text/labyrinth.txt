"Feeling trapped in these winding trails? Change your scale to unveil the details"

"Lost in this skeletal tale? A change in scale unveils the trail"

"As paths weave like a snail's frail trail, a fresh scale can unveil the detail"

"Gentle beings, light so fair. 
Brightening darkness everywhere. 
Calmness fills the air"
