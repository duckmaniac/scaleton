Entry #311 - October 1923

50 crates of Whole Milk: Delivered under the cover of night to the Blue Moon Cafe.
25 crates of Spiced Milk: Dropped at the Old Theatre's back entrance.
Payment: 60 silver coins, 15 golden tokens, and a rare jazz record.
Rumors are spreading about our passage. We must be more discreet.
Urgent: Change the piano code for the secret door. 
New code - C major scale, to throw off any suspicion.
Keep your bones light and steps quiet. The milk flows, but so do prying eyes.
