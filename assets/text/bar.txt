Looks like this door is locked. Guess the kitchen's off-limits!

Unlock the secret door with ease, by playing the major scale of C's

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Main character and Boney enter the bar at night]

Scaleton: I've never been here at night, it's so cool!

Boney: Yeah, it feels totally different in the dark, doesn't it?

Scaleton: Exactly! So, about that secret passage upstairs you mentioned?

Boney: Oh, that. My granddad built it during the Milk Prohibition to smuggle milk. But I'm not sure how to open it. I think the instructions must be hidden somewhere behind the bar counter

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Continue with the discovery of the note and the opening of the secret passage]

Scaleton: Got something! "Unlock the secret door with ease, by playing the major scale of C's" Guess that's our key!

Boney: Classic grandpa, always with the puzzles. Try it out on the piano!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[After playing the scale, a door opens]

Boney: You did it! This is how grandpa moved his secret milk stash

Scaleton: This is my chance... to step out and make people laugh. Here I come, world!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: Main character is about to leave]

Boney: You're really chasing your dream, huh? I'll miss your skeleton puns!

Scaleton: It's time I surfaced. I've got jokes to tell and bones to rattle!

Boney: One last thing â€“ can you take this 'Top 100 Country Hits' record to my grandpa upstairs? It's from Mrs. Garners

Scaleton:  Of course. Thanks for everything, Boney. Here's to finding new laughs!

Boney: Break a leg out there! And tell grandpa I said hi!

[Main Character sets off, ready for new adventures above ground]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wait a second, I'm heading out? That's not right, I need to go the other way

Oops, almost left the bar. I should be heading somewhere else

Hold on, am I leaving? No, no, I need to turn around and go the other way
