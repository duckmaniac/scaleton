Nope, can't leave without my clothes. I got some 'bare bones' to cover up!
I can't go anywhere without my wardrobe. I need something to 'dress my skeleton' in!
Leaving without my attire? Not a chance! I've got 'basic bones' to adorn!

No rest for the wicked... or for the skeletal!
Why should I sleep? I'm bone-tired all the time!
Dreams? Nah, I've been dead tired for centuries!

\"No Pun Intended: Volume Too\" ohh love this book!
\"Quantum Psychology\" why my mom bought it?"
\"Archery is for dummies\", sigh, my father dreams of me becoming an archer
