Scaleton: I was startin' to think you'd bail on me

Boney: Come on, you know I've got your back. Key's in my pocket, plan's all set. Ready to light up the surface with your jokes?

Scaleton: Yeah, been dreaming about this forever. Just... what if I bomb up there?

Boney: Bomb? You're all bones, buddy! What's there to lose? *laughs* Just try not to drop your skull when you're dropping punchlines

Scaleton: Dope *pauses* But seriously, is this even safe?

Boney: Safe as it'll ever be! And hey, how about a quick game of football for old times' sake?

Scaleton: Football now? You're not serious

Boney: Absolutely! A final kick-about in the underworld, what do you say?

Scaleton: Alright, game on. But let's not dawdle

[They engage in a game of football, their laughter echoing under the moonlit sky, reliving a fragment of their past.]

Boney: This is the life, huh? Alright, game's over. Time for the real deal. Ready to hit that secret passage?

Scaleton: Yeah, let's do this. Surface, here I come!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scaleton: Your turn, Boney!
Boney: Good try!
Scaleton: Nice move!
Boney: Try harder, Scale!
Scaleton: Gotcha!
Boney: Too slow!
Scaleton: Close one!
Boney: Watch this!
Scaleton: Great play, Bon!
Boney: Blocked!
Scaleton:Sneaky!
Boney: Catch this!
Scaleton: You're quick!
Boney: Tricky move!
Scaleton: Almost had it!
Boney: Nice dodge!

The Garners' place, mysterious yet charming. They collect unique artifacts, always something new in their window, like last week's handless clock. But the real magic is Mrs. Garner's legendary pies, rumored to be a 'borrowed' recipe from the surface

The Goodwins' house, where Boney lives. His dad is the heart of our community, a true family skeleton. Their home was my second childhood playground, always welcoming. They run the local bar, a place that brings everyone together, feeling like family

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oops, wrong way. I have to go where my buddy went
I'm going the wrong way. Need to catch up with my friend
Looks like I took a wrong turn. Better follow my buddy's path

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a bright memory from when I was a kid. We were playing soccer and these older teens took our ball. But Boney, he challenged them to a game for it. We played, won, and got our ball back. Felt like heroes that day

As skeletons, waiting for the mail isn't a problem. We've been chilling here for centuries. What's a few more days?
Why do skeletons make great postal workers? They're never tired of 'bone'-voyage jokes for every package!
Asked a skeleton if he hated waiting for the mail. He said, "Not at all, gives me a chance to bone up on my patience!"

"Bone Strength Brew" - Chilled calcium-rich milk for sturdy bones

"Spooky Spiced Latte" - Warm milk with vanilla and cinnamon, like a skeleton's hug

"Ghastly Gooey Chocolate Milk" - Thick chocolate milk with cream, a true graveyard hit!

"Milk Prohibition Ends: A Toast to 100 Years of Freedom"
Skeleton Daily - November 16, 2023

Celebrating 100 years since the Milk Prohibition's end, we remember when milk was banned for causing "too much excitement" in our skeleton world. Despite the risks, skeletons gathered in secret "milk bars" to enjoy their favorite drink.

Today, milk symbolizes our triumph over past restrictions. From hearty "Bone Strength Brew" to delightful "Ghastly Gooey Chocolate Milk," it's a testament to our community's resilience and joy. Here's to a century of milky freedom!

Nope, wrong direction. I should head over to the bar where my buddy is
I'm off route. Better head towards the bar to join my friend
Seems I made a detour. Time to head to the bar where my friend's waiting
