Dear Mom and Dad,

I’m taking a leap of faith to pursue my dream of becoming a stand-up comedian above ground. I cherish our home and the laughs we've shared, but I've got this funny feeling in my bones that there's more for me out there. Don’t worry, I’m not just clacking my jaw - I’ve thought this through. I promise to make you proud and fill the world with our signature humor. I'll keep in touch, and before you know it, I might just be the next big rib-tickler on the comedy scene!

With a humerus hug,
Your bony boy - Scaleton

Nope, can't leave without my clothes. I got some "bare bones" to cover up!
I can't go anywhere without my wardrobe. I need something to "dress my skeleton" in!
Leaving without my attire? Not a chance! I've got "basic bones" to adorn!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreams? Nah, I've been dead tired for centuries!
No rest for the wicked... or for the skeletal!
Why should I sleep? I'm bone-tired all the time!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Archery for dummies", sigh, my mother dreams of me becoming an archer like my father
"No Pun Intended: Volume Too" ohh love this book!
"Quantum Psychology" - never liked physics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my parents' room, I don't want to wake them up
Why did the skeleton go to the doctor about his snoring problem?
Because he couldn't find his "jaw-dropping" solution!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oops, look at the time! I better hurry up and meet my friend outside
Time's ticking and I'm just here boning around. Gotta rattle my bones and meet my buddy outside!
These clock hands are moving faster than my bones. Time to dash and catch up with my buddy!
